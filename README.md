## JS + CSS Clock 
### A clock built entirely with vanilla Javascript

A small, and fun, project from the [#Javascript30](https://javascript30.com/) challenge. To start off the new year, I wanted to dive deeper into Javascript by learning and using the new and more advanced (and sometimes obscure!) syntax introduced in ES6 in small projects. There's no better way to start than with the \#Javascript30 challenge where 30 vanilla JS projects are built in 30 days.

This project was especially fun and interesting because it introduced me to [ES6 Template Strings](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2015/01/ES6-Template-Strings), a new and efficient way to work with string interpolations and substitions.
